Where is Boss Health Bars? 'Barack Obama Ross' hasn't updated their mod for the current version of TModLoader so while it works, it won't appear on the current mod browser. It's still acessible by direct link here: javid.ddns.net/tModLoader/download.php?Down=mods/BossHealthBars.tmod?

Based on the Boss Health Bars mod, but with my own twist on it because why not.
* Supports multiple boss health bars.
* Show the boss' head icon.
* Kinda supports non-standard bosses.
* Made in about 4 hours therefore high quality.
