What's the difference between this and Boss Health Bars? Preference mostly. Barack Obama Ross' one has more customisation, whereas this one is more silly effects.

Based on the Boss Health Bars mod, but with my own twist on it because why not.
* Show the boss' head icon.
* Kinda supports non-standard bosses.
* Customised health bar graphics for some bosses.
* Has vague mod support.
* Has extra settings stored in Mod Configs/
